Plan on taking on the project with the following basic strategy.

Cleaning:
- Begin cleaning the data, looking for any rows with missing values (Null/NaN)
- Look for any values which may not be "realistic"(Check outliers)
- See which features appear very few times, and decide what to do (Categorical)
- Normalize numerical values for future use with models (No time variables)
- Make sure different features aren't counted twice (Mispelling, capitalization, etc.)
- Remove duplicates from the dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Check correlation between independent variables (Correlation matrix)
- Create plots of price vs. categorical features (Bar graphs)
- Plots of price vs. numerical features (Scatterplot)
- Box and whisker plot of price
- Whichever other types of plots come to use
- Calculating new variables from old (If applicable)
- Use of pivot tables, new to me in Python

Model Building:
Should be good to jump right in. The performance of our models will be found using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Will use a 80/20 training/testing split.
Will need feature selection for the models as well. Will be a new concept, other than for MLR.
Will provide a table with performance of each in the end.
This is a regression problem, so we will use the following algorithms.
- Multiple Linear Regression (Least squares)
- Lasso Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
